# MTA Ridership Analysis
## Introduction
For this project, we will use the MTA daily ridership from 2020-2025 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-daily-ridership-data-beginning-2020). Using ARIMA or Prophet model, we will be able to predict the number of ridership on specific days, also analyze the recovery rate of each transportation mode after COVID-19 lockdown. Then, we will forecast an expected date range when each mode is expected to return to its pre-lockdown ridership levels.


## MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020 - 2025

As we can see in the graph, there is a huge drop in ridership around the beginning of 2020. If we follow the trend of each transportation mode, we can notice that as the ridership gradually increases. The increases are noticable for all mode except Staten Island Railway due to higher volume of riderships of the other tranportations. Nevertheless, we will include all modes in our analysis.
